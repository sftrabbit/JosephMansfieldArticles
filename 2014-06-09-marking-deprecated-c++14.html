title: Marking as deprecated in C++14
description: The upcoming C++14 standard introduces an attribute for marking declarations as deprecated, useful for discouraging any use of the declared entity.
tag: C++

<p>It is common for entities in source code (functions, classes, etc.) to become obsolete or unsafe as a project undergoes development. It's usually a bad idea to remove those entities without any warning, as it'll break any code that interfaces with those entities. Instead, a good practice is to mark them as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation">deprecated</a> in an attempt to discourage their use.</p>
<p>The upcoming C++ release, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14">C++14</a>, introduces the <code>deprecated</code> attribute for specifying that an entity is deprecated. The compiler can then emit warnings whenever these entities are being used. In general, attributes are given as a comma-separated list in double square brackets and can be used in various locations. For example, we can deprecate a function by placing the <code>deprecated</code> attribute at the very beginning of the function declaration:</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
[[deprecated]]
void foo() {}

int main() {
	foo(); // we're using a deprecated function
}
{% endhighlight %}

<aside>Other existing attributes include <code>noreturn</code>, <code>carries_dependency</code>, and <code>alignas</code> (which has a different syntax).</aside>

<p>Compiled with the latest build of <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>, this gives the following warning:</p>

{% highlight clang %}
warning: 'foo' is deprecated [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
        foo();
        ^
note: 'foo' has been explicitly marked deprecated here
void foo() {}
     ^
{% endhighlight %}

<p>It is also possible to supply a message that may inform the users of the deprecated entity. This message must be given as a string literal in parentheses:

{% highlight cpp %}
[[deprecated("use bar instead")]]
void foo() {}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This gives the following warning instead:</p>

{% highlight clang %}
warning: 'foo' is deprecated: use bar instead [-Wdeprecated-declarations]
        foo();
        ^
note: 'foo' has been explicitly marked deprecated here
void foo() {}
     ^
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be applied to classes, typedefs, variables, non-static data members, enumerations, and template specializations. Here's a bunch of examples:</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
// Deprecate a function
[[deprecated]]
void foo();

// Deprecate a variable
[[deprecated]]
int x;

// Deprecate one declarator in a multi-declarator declaration
int y [[deprecated]], z;

// Deprecate a function parameter
int triple([[deprecated]] int x);

// Deprecate a class (or struct)
class [[deprecated]] my_class {
	public:
		// Deprecate a member
		[[deprecated]] int member;
};

// Deprecate an enum
enum [[deprecated]] animals {
	CAT, DOG, MOUSE
};

// Deprecate a typedef
[[deprecated]]
typedef int type;

// Deprecate a template specialization
template <typename T> class templ;

template <>
class [[deprecated]] templ<int> {};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>For those who are curious about the seemingly inconsistent placement of attributes, such as them appearing after the <code>class</code> and <code>enum</code> keywords, it is to distinguish between the deprecation of such a type and the deprecation of a variable of that type. For example, the following deprecates the variable <code>c</code> and not the class itself:</p>

{% highlight cpp %}
[[deprecated]] class C { } c;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute need only appear on a single declaration of a particular name or entity in order to mark it as deprecated. That is, later redeclaring without the attribute does not “undeprecate” the declaration. Placing the attribute in a header file declaration will ensure that it appears deprecated to all users of this header file.</p>
<p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute is supported by Clang 3.4 and GCC 4.9.</p>
