title: Avoiding the ambiguity of raw pointers
description: C++ is evolving and giving us more ways to write better, safer code. It is now commonly accepted that raw pointers should be avoided, as better alternatives are typically available. We look at the fundamental properties of raw pointers that make them unsuitable for modern code.

<p>I recently posted an answer on Stack Overflow about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22146244/150634">the uses of dynamic allocation and raw pointers</a> in which I highlighted alternatives that you should prefer. You'll probably see this kind of advice regularly in the context of modern C++ style. These rules exist because there's almost always safer alternatives that are less prone to introducing bugs.</p>
<p>We will look specifically at the properties of raw pointers (i.e. not smart pointers) that make them such a poor choice in most situations. It is important that types are chosen to be as specific as possible, so that they cannot be used in ways for which they weren't intended. I often think about what types <em>tell me</em>. Just by looking at a type of a variable (perhaps a function parameter), what can I determine about the values that it should take?</p>
<p>Raw pointers are far too ambiguous. Their possible uses are usually much broader than their intended use. If you see a function with a pointer parameter, it is difficult to know what you should be passing to the function without reading its documentation. Even then, you'd better hope you understood it correctly and are passing the correct things. The more specific we can be with our types, the better, as it ensures that code is readable, safe, and trustworthy.</p>
<p>Let's consider a pointer type, <code>T*</code>, and the questions it leaves unanswered:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Should it necessarily point at a valid <code>T</code> object?</li>
	<li>Can it be a null pointer?</li>
	<li>Can it point at an invalid object?</li>
	<li>What is the storage duration of the object?</li>
	<li>Who is responsible for <code>delete</code>ing the object, if necessary? (Who owns it?)</li>
	<li>Is the object just one element in an array of <code>T</code>?</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, all this pointer really says is “I store the address of what is <em>hopefully</em> a <code>T</code> object”. It's not nice to have all these mysteries whenever we see a raw pointer. Ideally, our types should be explicit about as many of these things as possible.</p>
<p>We will now consider some common uses of pointers and the ambiguities they present.</p>
<section>
	<h1>Arrays</h1>
	<p>Pointers are commonly used to point at the first element in an array. This is necessary when an array itself cannot be used, such as when the array has dynamic length or as the parameter of a function. The normal array subscripting syntax can be used with the pointer, so it can largely be treated as an array. Using pointers in this way is ambiguous because nothing about the type actually says it's pointing at an array.</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
struct Conversation {
	// ...
	std::string* messages;
	// ...
};
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here, only the plural name of the data member suggests that it might be pointing at the first element in array. How would I know without looking at how the pointer is initialized?</p>
	<p>In this case, we are much better off using a standard library container:</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
struct Conversation {
	// ...
	std::vector<std::string> messages;
	// ...
};
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Now we know for certain that <code>messages</code> is some kind of container of strings. This also has the benefit of having a much nicer interface, rather than having to perform dynamic resizing of arrays manually.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>C-style strings</h1>
	<p>It is common to read the type <code>const char*</code> as “a C-style string”. However, this is only because it is so often treated as a special case. We simply assume that it points at the first character in a null-terminated array of characters, which is quite a strong assumption. There's no reason this pointer couldn't just be pointing at a single <code>char</code>.</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
void print(const char*);
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>We would probably assume that we should pass a C-style string to this function. However, the type of the argument itself is not enough to know for certain. What would happen if we passed a pointer to a single <code>char</code>? What about a null pointer? Would it break? Why even allow this?</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
void print(const std::string&);
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>This is much better because it explicitly asks for a <code>std::string</code> and we know what a <code>std::string</code> represents. It is impossible for us to pass something that is not a string.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Optional arguments</h1>
	<p>While default arguments are supported by the language, raw pointers are sometimes used to allow omitting an argument from the middle of the argument list. Passing a null pointer is considered to be omitting an argument.</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
double complexAlgorithm(int, const Whatsamajig*, const std::string*, const double*);
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>This function has three arguments that are optional. However, we cannot know this for certain without reading the documentation. Are we sure it won't break if we pass a null pointer?</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
double complexAlgorithm(int, boost::optional<Whatsamajig>, boost::optional<std::string>, boost::optional<double>);
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>By using <code>boost::optional</code>, it is clear that these arguments are optional. It is expected that <code>boost::optional</code> will emerge as <code>std::optional</code> in the planned C++17 standard.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Reference semantics</h1>
	<p>You should generally prefer value semantics, where the value of an object is all that is important, rather than its identity. Sometimes, however, we need to pass a particular instance of an object around. Traditionally, this was done with pointers. In fact, C programmers sometimes refer to pointers as references.</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
void foo(int*);
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>It is intended that a pointer to an <code>int</code> is passed to this function so that it can modify that particular <code>int</code> object. Once again, this is not entirely clear from the type. What happens if we pass a null pointer? How do we know it's not supposed to take an array?</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
void foo(int&);
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>Here, on the other hand, the intention is clear. C++ has built-in reference types, which neatly express the concept of reference semantics. The passed argument cannot be anything but a valid <code>int</code> object. A reference cannot be null, so we don't even have to worry about that case at all.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h1>Passing ownership</h1>
	<p>When an object is dynamically allocated with <code>new</code>, some code must be responsible for <code>delete</code>ing that object. This code is said to “own” that object in some way. We often want to transfer ownership of an object between parts of our code.</p>
	<p>A common pattern in C libraries is to have functions that allocate objects and return pointers to those objects:</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
Image* allocateImage();
void deallocateImage(Image*);
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>It is then expected that the resulting pointer is later passed to a deallocation function when the object is no longer required. This can easily lead to memory leaks if the user fails to deallocate the object correctly. It is not clear at all from the return type that we now have the responsibility of deallocating the object or how we should do that.</p>
	<p>C++11 introduced a number of smart pointers. These smart pointers represent some particular ownership of a dynamically allocated object. For example, <code>std::unique_ptr</code> represents unique ownership, while <code>std::shared_ptr</code> represents shared ownership. The smart pointers will automatically deallocate the object when all ownership is given up.</p>
	<p>The previous C-like library interface would now be written as follows:</p>
{% highlight cpp %}
std::unique_ptr<Image> allocateImage();
{% endhighlight %}
	<p>This now clearly states that we are being given unique ownership of the <code>Image</code>. That is, the library is promising that it does not hold on to the object and so it is okay for you to give up ownership whenever you like. An added bonus is that now you do not need to manually deallocate the <code>Image</code>. This will happen automatically whenever you give up ownership.</p>

	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p>We have seen that raw pointers really are pretty bad at expressing intent, simply because they're so ambiguous. There is almost always a better alternative type you can use that expresses the values that the object should take more clearly. In fact, good code can often get away with using no raw pointers at all.</p>
	<p>Note that the use of raw pointers is independent of the use of <code>new</code> for dynamic allocation. We can pass pointers to objects with automatic or static storage, after all. However, <code>new</code> is equally as problematic and can be avoided by using smart pointers and <abbr title="Resource Acquisition Is Initialization">RAII</abbr> appropriately. My <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22146244/150634">answer on Stack Overflow</a> covers this briefly.</p>
